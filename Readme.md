# Objective-C

This repository contains assignments done by me during my Objective-C course (4 weeks).

## Lab 1

We're going to create an OS X command-line app that does some simple string manipulation. The app will take in two pieces of data from the user:
- a number, to indicate which operation to do
- a string, to operate on
Wrap the whole app in an infinite while loop, so users can do multiple operations. Be sure to print out the menu of options at the start of each loop of the app.

#####Operations
1. Uppercase
```
Make string uppercase.
```
2. Lowercase
```
Make string lowercase.
```
3. Numberize
```
Convert string to integer
```
4. Canadianize
```
Take the user's input and appent ", eh?" to it, Print the resulting string.
```
5. Respond
```
If the user input ends with a question mark, answer "I don't know". If the input ends with an exclamation point, respond with "Whoa, calm down!".
```
6. De-space-it
```
Replace all spaces with "-". Print the resulting string.
```

## Lab 2

Create a new command-line application. Create a class called Box that is a subclass of NSOBject. We're making a blueprint to hold the properties and methods that will apply to multiple instances of boxes.
- Add three properties to the box: height, width and length (float).
- Create an instance method that intializes a Box by taking in three float as parameters.
- Create an instance methods that will calcualte the volume and return it as a float.
- Add a method that takes in a another box and returns how many times one box will fit inside the other.
